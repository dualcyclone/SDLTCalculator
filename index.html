        <p>
            From the 4th December 2014 in the UK, the stamp duty rates have changed. However from 1st April 2015, legislation
            is due to be passed in Scotland which dissolves Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) in favour of the new Land and Buildings Transation
            Tax (LBTT).
        </p>
        <p>
            This site has been produced to help you work out what rates you are likely to pay for your intended purchase
            price.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please be aware, only purchases that have exchanged prior to 4th December 2014 can decide which SDLT rates
            can be applied to their purchase. From 1st April 2015 in Scotland only, the new Land and Building Transaction
            Tax will be the only tax that applies, and will replace the SDLT that applies in the rest of the UK.
        </p>
